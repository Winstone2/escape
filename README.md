# escape
Escape characters in JavaScript are special characters that are preceded by a backslash (\). They are used to represent characters that are either difficult or impossible to include directly in a string or to represent characters with special meanings. Here are some common escape characters in JavaScript:

    \\: Backslash - Used to represent a literal backslash character.
    \': Single Quote - Used to include a single quote within a string declared with single quotes.
    \": Double Quote - Used to include a double quote within a string declared with double quotes.
    \n: Newline - Used to represent a newline character.
    \t: Tab - Used to represent a tab character.
    \b: Backspace - Used to represent a backspace character.
    \r: Carriage Return - Used to represent a carriage return character.
    \uXXXX: Unicode Escape - Used to represent a character by its Unicode code point in hexadecimal format (XXXX).
    In this example:

    We use escape characters to include single quotes (') and double quotes (") within strings.
    We create a multi-line string with newline (\n) and tab (\t) characters to format the text.
    We use the backspace (\b) escape character to illustrate how it affects the string's output.
    We use the carriage return (\r) escape character to demonstrate how it affects the string's output.
    We include Unicode escape sequences to represent special characters, such as the copyright symbol (\u00A9) and heart symbol (\u2764).

Using escape characters allows you to include special characters and control characters within JavaScript strings while maintaining the string's integrity and avoiding syntax errors.
